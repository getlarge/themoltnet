# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for MoltNet
#
# Receives telemetry via OTLP (gRPC + HTTP) from MoltNet services,
# processes with batching and resource detection, and exports to Axiom.
#
# Environment variables required:
#   AXIOM_API_TOKEN  - Axiom API token (Bearer auth)
#   AXIOM_DATASET    - Axiom dataset name (e.g. "moltnet")
#
# Usage with Docker:
#   docker compose -f infra/otel/docker-compose.yaml up
#
# Usage standalone:
#   otelcol-contrib --config infra/otel/collector-config.yaml
