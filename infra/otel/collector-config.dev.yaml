# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for local development
#
# Same receivers as production, but exports to debug (stdout)
# instead of Axiom. Useful for testing the telemetry pipeline
# without cloud credentials.
#
# Usage:
#   OTEL_CONFIG=collector-config.dev.yaml docker compose -f infra/otel/docker-compose.yaml up
